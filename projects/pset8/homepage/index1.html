                  When people age they can begin to feel like they are losing control of their health.<br>
                  Sometimes they wake up with a muscle or bone aching or a hurt lower back and don't know why.<br>
                  I'm here to tell you about a few ways that can slow the forever ticking age clock that goes on inside all of us.

                <li>
                  I began my journey in health about 10 years ago when deciding to go vegan for health reasons.<br>
                  I heard all sorts of stories about healing my eyes, making me feel euphoric, and helping the world at the same time.<br>
                  This journey lasted about 3 years until one day I felt like I was just doing it to do it.<br>
                  I no longer had the drive I once had to lift in the gym and my energy levels felt at a constant low to medium level.<br>
                  Now granted this may have been user error where I just wasn't eating enough or enough of the right stuff, but it felt like a full-time job always checking and being sure something was vegan, preparing food took a while, and my previous enjoyment had disappeared.<br>
                  This is when I began looking for other options and found the idea of a low carb diet.<br>
                  Now some may say this way of eating presents many of the same difficulties as being vegan, which I would agree, but the benefits seem to be fast and far reaching.<br>
                  I view this diet as a catch all, because it almost completely removes the possibility of consuimg High Glycemic Index foods, which according to this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692165/" target=_blank>NIH study on Dietary glycemia as a determinant of health and longevity</a> seems to play a large part in aging the eyes as well as other parts of the human body.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  From my experience many people have difficulties adapting to a low carb lifestyle and I would say a lot of this has to do with a sugar addiction that goes unchecked for years and years.<br>
                  Sugar does no good and yet it is what we reward our kids with when they do something well. Sugar addiction in our society WILL be what we look back on as we do mother's smoking cigarettes and drinking while pregnant.<br>
                  Doctor's know the dangers of sugar, but what quicker way to lose clients then to tell them to stop something they love so much?<br>
                  A low carbohydrate diet is not necessary, but it does make you aware of your body's true hunger response, what it craves in a sugar-free environment, and how your body leans towards a homeostasis of a certain weight and body type void of processed foods.<br>
                  People are always looking for a miracle diet, the truth is, it's probably not the one you do regularly. Sometimes you just have to switch it up and buy into a new mindset.<br>
                  Out running a compromising diet is impossible. Sweating and stressing your body for 3 days a week will not get you closer to your goals, but changing what you eat and your relationship with food can do just that.<br>
